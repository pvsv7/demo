### Jenkins Pipeline Documentation: License Expiry Check

#### **Purpose**
This Jenkins pipeline job is designed to automate the monitoring of a license expiry date stored in a Jenkins environment variable. The job runs once daily and performs the following tasks:

1. **Check License Expiry Date:** 
   - The job retrieves the license expiry date from a specific Jenkins environment variable.
   - It checks if the expiry date is within the next 60 days.

2. **Send Notifications:**
   - **Expiry Date Warning:** If the expiry date is within 60 days, a notification is sent to alert the responsible team.
   - **Missing or Incorrect Format:** If the expiry date is missing or not in the expected format, a notification is sent indicating an issue.

3. **Post-Renewal Update:**
   - Once the license is renewed, the Jenkins environment variable must be manually updated with the new expiry date to continue accurate monitoring.

#### **Pipeline Steps**

1. **Job Schedule:**
   - The job is scheduled to run once daily (typically using a cron schedule).

2. **Fetch Expiry Date:**
   - The pipeline accesses a specific Jenkins environment variable (e.g., `LICENSE_EXPIRY_DATE`) to fetch the current license expiry date.

3. **Validate Expiry Date:**
   - The pipeline checks if the fetched expiry date is:
     - **Present:** Ensuring that the environment variable is not empty.
     - **Correct Format:** The date must be in a specific format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).

4. **Check Timeframe:**
   - The pipeline calculates the number of days between the current date and the expiry date.
   - If the expiry date is less than or equal to 60 days from the current date, a warning notification is triggered.

5. **Send Notification:**
   - **Warning Notification:** Sent if the expiry date is within 60 days.
   - **Error Notification:** Sent if the expiry date is not found or is in an incorrect format.

6. **Post-Renewal Action:**
   - After the license is renewed, the corresponding environment variable must be updated with the new expiry date to maintain accurate monitoring.

#### **Error Handling**
- **Missing Expiry Date:**
  - The job sends a notification if the expiry date environment variable is not set.
- **Invalid Date Format:**
  - The job validates the date format and sends a notification if the date is not in the expected format.

#### **Environment Variable**
- **Name:** `LICENSE_EXPIRY_DATE`
- **Expected Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Update Process:** Manually update this variable post-license renewal.

#### **Notifications**
- **Recipients:** The DevOps team or relevant stakeholders.
- **Message Content:**
  - For expiry within 60 days: "The license is set to expire on [Expiry Date]. Please renew the license."
  - For missing/invalid expiry date: "The license expiry date is missing or in an incorrect format. Please check the environment variable."

#### **Scheduling**
- **Cron Expression:** Example: `H 2 * * *` (Runs daily at a random time between 2 AM and 3 AM).
