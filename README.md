**Subject:** Assistance Required: Unable to SSH from On-Premises Database Server to AWS EC2 Instance

**Dear [Support Team's Name],**

I hope this email finds you well. We are currently experiencing an issue with connecting from our on-premises database server to an AWS EC2 instance via SSH. Below are the steps we have already taken based on the documentation provided:

1. **Network Load Balancer**: We have successfully created a network load balancer and added the EC2 instance as a target.
2. **VPC Endpoint Service**: A VPC endpoint service has been created, and it is routed to the network load balancer. We have allowed your account principal as required and shared the VPC endpoint service name with the CAS team for further configuration.
3. **Firewall Clearance**: We had initially raised a ticket for firewall clearance, and it has been confirmed that the clearance is now complete.

**Issue:**
- Despite these configurations, we are still unable to SSH into the EC2 instance from our on-premises database server.
- We have validated that the VPC endpoint can connect to the EC2 instance using the AWS Analyzer, which worked as expected.
- However, when attempting to connect from the database server to the transit service IP address, the connection fails.

Could you please assist us in identifying any missing configurations or adjustments that need to be made to facilitate SSH access from our database server to the EC2 instance? Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.

**Best regards,**
